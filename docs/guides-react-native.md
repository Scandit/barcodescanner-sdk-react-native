**Important Notice:**
We are deprecating the 5.x API on all platforms (except Linux). Release 5.19 in April 2021 will be our final. Applications running 5.x will continue to work, and we will continue to release critical bug fixes and security patches only, for one year. We encourage you to migrate to 6.x and take advantage of our latest / advanced features and improved performance. Migration guides on all platforms are available at docs.scandit.com.  
As always, please reach out to support@scandit.com with any questions or support migrating your application to 6.x.
